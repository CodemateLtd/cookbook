## What is this

This repository contains all of the recipes, guidelines, templates, documentation you can reuse to cook a delicious digital project. Think of it as a reference of practices to use when working as a team; a starting point to define your own team’s practices.

This cookbook is about helping **teams** succeed first and foremost, projects being successful is only a consequence. **It defines where we want to be**, not necessarily where we always are. It is meant to apply to **all teams, and all team members** – we are knowledge workers first and foremost, our most important role is to successfully think, organise, and share knowledge. Code, designs, plans are only specific artifacts.
