# Contribution guidelines

## Code reviews

We do code reviews to ensure our work is of good quality, and to share knowledge. Reviews come in all shapes and sizes – from thorough point-by-point pull request reviews in GitLab to simple discussion of the proposed changes.

### Why we review each other’s work

*   Improve the overall quality of the work.
*   Enforce and propagate our standards of quality, best practices, work methodologies, and coding styles.
*   Share the responsibility and knowledge for any given piece of work.
*   Learn from each other’s approaches and skillsets.

### Guidelines for code reviews

When presenting code for review, or reviewing code, follow these guidelines:

*   Try to make the review beneficial for both reviewee and reviewer.
*   Give enough information to the reviewer so they know where to start.
*   Think about the bigger picture.
*   Concentrate on the intention rather than the syntax – stylistic issues should be taken care of by your linter.
*   Reviews do not need to focus on the negative - if a piece of code is good, it is worth stating as well.

### Code reviews in practice

We use GitLab’s [Merge Requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/) feature or GitHub’s [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/requesting-a-pull-request-review/) for most of our work, and do code reviews there with **Merge request approvals / Pull request reviews**. You will use this on a daily basis, take some time to learn how best to leverage those tools.
